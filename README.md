# Spring Boot
<hr>
Certainly! Spring Boot is a powerful and widely used framework for building Java-based web applications and microservices. It simplifies the development process by providing defaults for configuration and eliminating boilerplate code. Below is a brief overview and a step-by-step guide to help you get started with Spring Boot.

### What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is part of the larger Spring Framework and is designed to simplify the development of production-ready applications. It promotes convention over configuration and comes with defaults for common use cases, reducing the need for extensive setup and boilerplate code.

### Getting Started:

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Spring Boot applications typically require Java 8 or later.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

#### Step 2: Create a Spring Boot Project

1. **Using Spring Initializer:**
   - Visit [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/).
   - Choose your project options (e.g., Project, Language, Spring Boot version).
   - Add dependencies (e.g., Spring Web for building web applications).
   - Click "Generate" to download the project as a ZIP file.

2. **Using IDE:**
   - Alternatively, you can create a new project in your IDE and select Spring Initializer or Spring Boot as the project type.

#### Step 3: Build and Run Your Project

1. Extract the downloaded ZIP file or open the project in your IDE.
2. Write your application code in the generated source files.
3. Run your application. There's usually a "Run" button if you're using an IDE.

#### Step 4: Create a Simple Controller

```java
// src/main/java/com/example/demo/HelloController.java

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Test Your Controller

1. Run your application.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello).

You should see the message "Hello, Spring Boot!".

### Key Concepts:

1. **Annotations:**
   - `@SpringBootApplication`: Marks the main class and includes various annotations for configuration.
   - `@RestController`: Indicates that a class is a RESTful controller.

2. **Spring Boot Starters:**
   - These are a set of convenient dependency descriptors that you can include in your application.

3. **Application Properties:**
   - `application.properties` or `application.yml`: Configuration files where you can specify settings.

4. **Spring Boot DevTools:**
   - Optional dependency that provides features like automatic restarts during development.

5. **Packaging and Running:**
   - You can package your application as a JAR or WAR file and run it using `java -jar`.

This is just a basic introduction to Spring Boot. As you delve deeper, you'll encounter features like data access with Spring Data, security with Spring Security, and more. Feel free to ask for more specific details or guidance on any aspect of Spring Boot!
## Application.properties
<hr>
In a Spring Boot application, `application.properties` is a configuration file that allows you to define various settings for your application. It is a key-value pair file where each line represents a property and its value. This file is typically located in the `src/main/resources` directory of your project.

Here are some common uses of `application.properties`:

1. **Database Configuration:**
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase
   spring.datasource.username=myuser
   spring.datasource.password=mypassword
   ```

2. **Server Configuration:**
   ```properties
   server.port=8080
   server.servlet.context-path=/myapp
   ```

3. **Logging Configuration:**
   ```properties
   logging.level.root=info
   logging.file=myapp.log
   ```

4. **Spring Profiles:**
   ```properties
   spring.profiles.active=dev
   ```

   This example activates the "dev" profile. You can have different configuration properties for each profile.

5. **Custom Properties:**
   ```properties
   myapp.custom.property=value
   ```

   You can define custom properties specific to your application.

6. **Thymeleaf (Template Engine) Configuration:**
   ```properties
   spring.thymeleaf.prefix=classpath:/templates/
   spring.thymeleaf.suffix=.html
   ```

   If you're using Thymeleaf for templates, you can configure the template engine settings.

7. **Security Configuration:**
   ```properties
   spring.security.user.name=user
   spring.security.user.password=password
   ```

   This is an example of setting up a basic username and password for security.

8. **Actuator Endpoints Configuration:**
   ```properties
   management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
   ```

   This example exposes all actuator endpoints via the web.

These are just a few examples, and the properties you can configure are extensive. The `application.properties` file provides a convenient way to centralize and manage the configuration of your Spring Boot application.

You can also use `application.yml` as an alternative to `application.properties`. The YAML format allows for a more human-readable and structured configuration.

Remember to be cautious with sensitive information such as database passwords or API keys and consider using environment variables or more secure methods for managing such data in production environments.

### Curd Operation
<hr>
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are fundamental operations in database applications, and they are commonly implemented in Spring Boot applications using Spring Data JPA. Below is a basic example illustrating how to perform CRUD operations in a Spring Boot application.

### 1. Entity Class:

Create an entity class representing the data model. This class will be mapped to a database table.

```java
// User.java

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Constructors, getters, setters, and other methods...
}
```

### 2. Repository Interface:

Create a repository interface that extends `JpaRepository` to handle database operations.

```java
// UserRepository.java

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    // Additional custom queries can be defined here if needed
}
```

### 3. Service Class:

Create a service class to encapsulate the business logic and interact with the repository.

```java
// UserService.java

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    @Autowired
    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userRepository.findAll();
    }

    public Optional<User> getUserById(Long userId) {
        return userRepository.findById(userId);
    }

    public User createUser(User user) {
        return userRepository.save(user);
    }

    public User updateUser(Long userId, User updatedUser) {
        if (userRepository.existsById(userId)) {
            updatedUser.setId(userId);
            return userRepository.save(updatedUser);
        }
        return null; // Handle not found scenario appropriately
    }

    public void deleteUser(Long userId) {
        userRepository.deleteById(userId);
    }
}
```

### 4. Controller Class:

Create a REST controller to handle incoming HTTP requests.

```java
// UserController.java

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.Optional;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    private final UserService userService;

    @Autowired
    public UserController(UserService userService) {
        this.userService = userService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userService.getAllUsers();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Optional<User> getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return userService.getUserById(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
        return userService.createUser(user);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User updatedUser) {
        return userService.updateUser(id, updatedUser);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        userService.deleteUser(id);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `UserController` exposes RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations.
- The `UserService` encapsulates the business logic, and it interacts with the `UserRepository` to perform database operations.
- The `UserRepository` extends `JpaRepository`, providing basic CRUD functionalities.

This is a basic example, and you may need to customize it based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you might want to add validation, error handling, and security measures depending on your application's needs.
# Operation In Postman
<hr>
To perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Postman, you can use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and send requests to your API endpoints. Below are the steps for each CRUD operation:

### 1. **Create (POST) Operation:**

1. Open Postman.

2. Select the request type as `POST`.

3. Enter the API endpoint URL.

4. Go to the "Body" tab and choose the `raw` option.

5. Enter the JSON data for creating a resource.

   Example JSON for creating a user:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "john_doe",
       "email": "john.doe@example.com"
   }
   ```

6. Click on the "Send" button to submit the POST request.

### 2. **Read (GET) Operation:**

1. Open Postman.

2. Select the request type as `GET`.

3. Enter the API endpoint URL.

4. Click on the "Send" button to submit the GET request.

### 3. **Update (PUT) Operation:**

1. Open Postman.

2. Select the request type as `PUT`.

3. Enter the API endpoint URL.

4. Go to the "Body" tab and choose the `raw` option.

5. Enter the JSON data for updating a resource.

   Example JSON for updating a user:
   ```json
   {
       "username": "john_doe_updated",
       "email": "john.doe.updated@example.com"
   }
   ```

6. Click on the "Send" button to submit the PUT request.

### 4. **Delete (DELETE) Operation:**

1. Open Postman.

2. Select the request type as `DELETE`.

3. Enter the API endpoint URL.

4. Click on the "Send" button to submit the DELETE request.

These are general steps, and the specifics will depend on your API design and the structure of your endpoints. Ensure that you have the correct API endpoint URLs and provide the necessary data in the request body for POST and PUT requests.

Remember to handle error responses appropriately and check the response status and content for successful or unsuccessful CRUD operations.

Make sure your API is correctly implemented to handle these HTTP methods and their corresponding operations. Additionally, always follow best practices for API design and security.

# Annotations
<hr>
Spring Boot relies heavily on annotations to simplify the configuration and behavior of your applications. Here are some key annotations used in Spring Boot:

### 1. **Main Application Class:**

- **`@SpringBootApplication`:** This annotation is a combination of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It is typically placed on the main class of your application.

    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class MyApplication {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
        }
    }
    ```

### 2. **Controller Annotations:**

- **`@RestController`:** Indicates that the class is a RESTful controller. It combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

    ```java
    @RestController
    public class MyController {
        // Controller methods...
    }
    ```

- **`@RequestMapping`:** Maps HTTP requests to handler methods. You can use specialized versions like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

    ```java
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
    ```

### 3. **Dependency Injection Annotations:**

- **`@Autowired`:** Injects dependencies automatically. It can be used on fields, methods, and constructors.

    ```java
    @Service
    public class MyService {
    
        private final MyRepository myRepository;
    
        @Autowired
        public MyService(MyRepository myRepository) {
            this.myRepository = myRepository;
        }
    }
    ```

### 4. **Component Annotations:**

- **`@Component`:** Indicates that a class is a Spring component. Spring will automatically detect and register it as a bean.

    ```java
    @Component
    public class MyComponent {
        // Component logic...
    }
    ```

- **`@Service`, `@Repository`:** Specializations of `@Component` for service and repository classes.

### 5. **Configuration Annotations:**

- **`@Configuration`:** Indicates that a class declares one or more `@Bean` methods. It is often used in combination with `@Autowired`.

    ```java
    @Configuration
    public class MyConfig {
    
        @Bean
        public MyBean myBean() {
            return new MyBean();
        }
    }
    ```

### 6. **JPA Annotations:**

- **`@Entity`:** Marks a class as a JPA entity, representing a table in the database.

    ```java
    @Entity
    public class User {
        // Entity properties...
    }
    ```

- **`@Repository`:** Indicates that the class is a Spring Data repository.

### 7. **Logging Annotations:**

- **`@Slf4j`:** A Lombok annotation that automatically generates a logger field for the class.

    ```java
    @Slf4j
    public class MyService {
        // Use the 'log' field for logging
    }
    ```

### 8. **Security Annotations:**

- **`@EnableWebSecurity`:** Used to enable Spring Security in a Spring Boot application.

    ```java
    @EnableWebSecurity
    public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
        // Security configuration...
    }
    ```

### 9. **Testing Annotations:**

- **`@SpringBootTest`:** Indicates that a class is a Spring Boot test.

    ```java
    @SpringBootTest
    public class MyApplicationTests {
        // Test methods...
    }
    ```

These are just a few of the many annotations provided by Spring Boot. The framework uses annotations extensively to simplify configuration and reduce boilerplate code. Depending on your application's needs, you may encounter and use additional annotations for features like caching, messaging, and more.
